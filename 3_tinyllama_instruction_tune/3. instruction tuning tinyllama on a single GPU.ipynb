    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama) project \"aims to pretrain a 1.1B Llama model on 3 trillion tokens.\" 1.1B tokens represents a considerable step up from the small GPT model we [previously fine-tuned](../2_gpt2_single_gpu/2.%20GPT2%20on%20a%20single%20GPU.ipynb). That model had 124M parameters; TinyLlama, while still small by the standards of most widely-used LLMs, is almost ten times the size. We will need around 20GB VRAM at a bare minimum to fine-tune this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instruction Tuning\n",
    "We are going to focus on instruction tuning in this example. Instruction Tuning is a supervised learning technique in which we train the model on instruction/output pairs with the goal of training the model to follow human instructions. Before instruction tuning, the base model is trained on next-token completion. We saw this in the GPT2 example: we provided the start of a story and the model completed it. An instruction-tuned model, on the other hand, is trained to answer a question or instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This repository](https://github.com/xiaoya-li/Instruction-Tuning-Survey) contains a wealth of information on the current state of the field of instruction tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [TinyLlama repository](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama/tree/main/sft) includes scripts for fine-tuning. While these will be useful references, we will try to proceed with an approach similar to that used in the gpt2 and t5-small notebooks--purely for the sake of making this notebook a reasonable learning step following those.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Data\n",
    "We will use the [SlimOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/SlimOrca) dataset. This is a curated subset of the much larger [OpenOrca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Open-Orca/OpenOrca) dataset. Why this dataset? It's one of the most popular sources of instruction data on Hugging Face, and its size is more manageable than the full OpenOrca dataset. That's all!\n",

Local authorities have charged the suspect with murder and attempted murder in connection with the horrific crime. In this article, we delve into the chilling incident, the suspect, and the impact it has had on the community.\\n\\nThe Incident\\n\\nThe alarming event took place at a popular restaurant in Sydney, Australia. A woman and her date were enjoying their meal \\u2013 blissfully unaware of the tragic circumstances that would soon unfold. As they shared conversation and indulged in their dinner, a man approached the couple and, without warning, began to stab them with a sharp object.\\n\\nPatrons at the restaurant scrambled for safety, as the assailant continued his violent rampage. Bystanders quickly called emergency services, who promptly arrived at the scene. Although both victims were rushed to a nearby hospital, the woman succumbed to her injuries. The man she was on a date with remained in critical condition, fighting for his life.\\n\\nThe Suspect\\n\\nInitial investigations revealed that the alleged attacker had no known connections to the victims \\u2013 adding to the mystifying nature of this sudden and brutal assault. Witnesses reported that the assailant seemed to have no specific motive and appeared to carry out the act senselessly.\\n\\nFollowing a thorough investigation, local police identified and arrested the suspect. During the process, it was discovered that the alleged attacker had a history of criminal behavior and a troubled past, though it is unclear if this played a role in the tragic incident.\\n\\nAuthorities have formally charged the man with murder and attempted murder in connection with the heinous crime. He awaits a hearing to determine a trial date and, if convicted, could face a life sentence in prison.\\n\\nThe Community's Response\\n\\nThe shocking nature of the crime has left the residents of Sydney reeling, as they struggle to come to terms with the harrowing event. The restaurant where the attack occurred has since been closed, with a makeshift memorial being created outside to commemorate the victims.\\n\\nMany have questioned how such a vicious crime could happen in what is considered to be one of the safest cities in the world. This tragic event has spurred local officials to reassess current security measures and devise strategies to reinforce public safety. Additionally, discussions surrounding mental health and criminal rehabilitation have surfaced as residents seek to comprehend the actions of the alleged perpetrator and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\\n\\nIn the wake of the stabbing, the community has banded together with an outpouring of grief and support for the victims and their families. Candlelight vigils have been held, and an online fundraising campaign is underway to assist the surviving victim with his medical expenses and recovery.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe tragic attack in Sydney serves as a chilling reminder that senseless acts of violence can happen anywhere and at any time. The community's response to this horrific and seemingly random act of brutality has been one of solidarity and determination to prevent such incidents in the future. As the case unfolds, the victims and their families remain in the hearts of the community, who are grieving the devastating loss of a life cut tragically short and supporting the recovering victim as he continues to endure this unimaginable ordeal.\",\n",

It begins by using the [`HFArgumentParser`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.36.1/en/internal/trainer_utils#transformers.HfArgumentParser) to configure the training arguments. Earlier, the training code defined a number of `dataclass`es for e.g. training arguments, data arguments, etc. `HFArgumentParser` provides an approach for parsing command line arguments directly into instances of these dataclass types. So instead of simply defining arguments in notebook cells, as we've been doing, this approach provides a structured way to parse command line arguments. And, indeed, the repo provides a [shell script](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama/blob/main/sft/script.sh) for running the fine-tuning script with a defined set of arguments.\n",
