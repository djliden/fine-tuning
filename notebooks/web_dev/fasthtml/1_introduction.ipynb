    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will develop an intuition for the basic principles and concepts of web development. We will do so using the FastHTML library, which enables us to create websites and web applications using Python. Crucially, it still requires considerable understanding of how web pages and web apps are built and how they work. It won't make it easy to build web pages without understanding HTML/CSS or HTTP requests. But it might mean that there is now a \"Pythonic\" way to learn it and to get started quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "FastHTML is a bit different from other web development frameworks insofar as you can write Python functions to handle server logic without having to write a separate HTML template and Javascript for client-side interactivity. This is because FastHTML is designed to be a Pythonic way to generate HTML content, and it uses htmx for client-side interactivity. This approach is somewhat controversial, as exemplified by this Hacker News exchange with the creator of FastHTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hacker News exchange with FastHTML creator](./images/jh_soc_hn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key thing to remember here is that we return HTML content directly from our Python functions rather than populating a template and then rendering it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this guide is to start as simply as possible and to add more and more complexity to that simple start, explaining what is happening at each step and mapping the FastHTML code to a broader understanding of web development concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Simple Start\n",
    "As always...let's start with a Hello, World. In this case, we will develop a web page that says \"Hello, World\" that you can serve and see in your browser."
