    "# Changing the Appearance of FastHTML Applications and Components\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you change the appearance of your FastHTML application? There are a few different ways. Be aware: they require you to know at least some CSS. We'll cover the following:\n",
    "1. PicoCSS: the default CSS framework used by FastHTML\n",
    "2. Using a different CSS framework\n",
    "3. Applying inline styles\n",
    "4. Using your own custom CSS stylesheet\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding there approaches—and where to find more details on CSS—will give you a great deal of control ovet the appearance of your site.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CSS Basics\n",
    "Let's start by answering a few basic questions about CSS and how it affects a webpage. We're not going to provide any examples of CSS outside the context of FastHTML; for a more comprehensive overview, see the [CSS Basics MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)\n",
    "1. What is CSS? *CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that lets you selectively apply style options to HTML elements. With CSS, you specify the types of HTML components you want to be affected, and how you want them displayed on the page.*\n",
    "2. What is a CSS framework? *A [CSS framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) like PicoCSS is an opinionated library of styles/templates that provides pre-defined classes and components to help you quickly build and style web pages.*\n",
    "3. How is CSS applied? *CSS can be applied in three ways: inline styles (directly in the HTML element), internal styles (within a `<style>` tag in the HTML document), and external styles (linking to an external CSS file).*\n",
    "\n",
    "## PicoCSS\n",
    "PicoCSS is the default CSS framework used by FastHTML. It's the reason the pages we put together in [part 1](./tutorial_1.ipynb) looked like they did and were not just black text on white backgrounds. Let's see what happens when we disable Pico in the app configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write the below file to `app_2.py` and run it with `python app_2.py`."
